Notes:

Amit started Mobidev, at Wayne State, mobile development was just becoming big at the time (and still is IMO)
learner-long-life â€” Today at 3:15 PM

Imari: there is still a market for a participatory meetup event for devs

Amit started in 2014 for angular JS
one of his mentors recommended him to join meetup, part networking while learning. Hidden agenda of having more experienced devs to learn from ðŸ™‚
other groups are starting to run out of speakers
inclusive, suggestions, but there is a culture doesn't shun tech choices

no worries, i do that a lot too

Imari: the tech world is very defined and niche, when you come to a meetup you are part of a culture, which also includes ways of speaking, humor, etc.

Imari was talking to someone the other day about getting underrpresented groups into tech. Most people leave if they don't feel part of the group, get the jokes, or have fun etc.

@ pc.su talks to some tech founders and has gotten excited about AI from their explanations

Amit's startup is The Mobile Dev, both mobile / responsive development, and for users on-the-go
There are Detroit tech founders. What are they looking for? Can we serve them too?

Amit has been inviting non-tech friends, a designer has been showing up and contributing well to meetup.
Create-a-thon instead of just hack-a-thon

Amit learned a lot since he started working and creating it, after school. Goes to founders events to connect with others (devs, founders, creators).
To exchange ideas, to exchange help

It's difficult to sell SaaS (Software-as-a-service) as a product. But building it once lets you easily deploy a similar product in the future.
Amit's pitched for future clients: they may want to sponsor a group, and we manage code challenges and bring in devs/creators-in-training

This is like a distributed apprenticeship program.
Could have prizes, payment, rewards, food/drink, or event
Localized Fiverr (!)

Amit would like to build it with us and others
We could have Different levels of commitment based on participation

learner-long-life â€” Today at 3:32 PM
Or people can just show up casually and socialize at the meetup
Suggests a DAO-like structure. You get out of it what you put in
Code With Friends should always be an inclusive / welcoming environment. How will memberships who desire different levels of involvement / contribution interact with each other, or how will events communicate these levels in a mutually rewarding way for everyone?
Change name? Create-With-Friends? Build-With-Friends?

Amit wants to move away from just a "hack" mindset, a quick-and-dirty prototype
Imari: at Grand Rapids (Social Weekend for Good) the teams for multidisciplinary, included writers, designers
 
vande â€” Today at 3:41 PM

Imari: meetups are about 3-8 people. Probably most find it on meetup.com
4-5 core group of people are regulars now

Imari has been hosting about about 3 months now
"This is a store that's always open", consistency is important
 
learner-long-life â€” Today at 3:55 PM
