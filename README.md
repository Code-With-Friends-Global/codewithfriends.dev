Feedbacks from Tonight: 

@imari8 @vande idea: ticket system for people who need help on a specific topic, to keep track of discussion. @dys üêô the forum system would be similar to this.

@JeffH have a place / channel where they can post a screenshot to ask help, anyone who sees it can try to google / try it out / how to help this person. to prepare for, or initiate a pair programming session. (Great idea!)

@Brian - R other servers have a slash command that auto-creates a channel for creating a ticket.

@CCHUN we want new people to feel welcome. What about videos that automatically let you link or transition into pair programming when you get stuck, or want to talk to someone? "

put our videos up on our website, link and organize it by name or topic. How to make it easy to find? How to decide what topics to film?

@dys üêô rinkeby / homestead lol

" @dys üêô@CCHUN crowdsource the labeling and editing of videos, to jump directly / skip ahead just to the part that you are interested in.  VSCode has a liveshare pair programming feature. "

" @CCHUN documentation is important, to communicate software to people who come after and want to add onto it.

CodeSandBox
@pc.su mentoring and mentee can be roles (discord has this feature) @JeffH we could have a skills matrix

@BeachArcology event notification setting we can look into

@CCHUN people can post events when they are happening. "
" check notification settings for events, are people getting notified, e.g. on their phones, when our events start.  also how to silence notifications if it's annoying. "

Dys: 3d model to work on NFT, NFT contract deployment, you can upload your code when you deploy 

if a beginner joins the server and doesn't know anyone yet, how do they know who to ask for what topic? "
 we can use the forum channel, after community mode, to serve as a profile as well "

@dys üêô and @life-long-learner want to learn blender, but it's dense. there are 8,000 videos online. Maybe pick a single course and meet regularly as a group? "

" @pc.su knows some startup people working on cool stuff, can invite for future talks

@JeffH can contribute skills in JIRA and confluence tools, for bug tracking and a wiki, made by Atlassian " (edited)

" @imari8 designing of front end, social engineering  coming up with ideas and communicate social learning ideas
